# Lean Architecture

Lean Architecture is a software architecture framework inspired by Clean Architecture but designed for enhanced efficiency and reduced boilerplate code.

## Overview

This repository presents an alternative approach to software architecture that aims to streamline development processes while maintaining the principles of Clean Architecture. By reducing unnecessary complexity and boilerplate code, Lean Architecture facilitates faster development cycles and easier maintenance.

## Key Features

- **Efficiency**: Lean Architecture focuses on minimizing overhead and maximizing productivity by simplifying the structure of software projects.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Say goodbye to repetitive code and unnecessary layers. Lean Architecture emphasizes a minimalistic approach to building applications.
- **Flexibility**: While staying true to the core principles of Clean Architecture, Lean Architecture offers flexibility for developers to adapt to various project requirements and constraints.

## Getting Started

To get started with Lean Architecture, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Jewelch/lean_architecture.git`
2. **Explore the Codebase**: Take a look at the structure of the project and familiarize yourself with the key components.
3. **Experiment**: Feel free to experiment with Lean Architecture in your own projects and see how it fits your development workflow.
